# PSArcFileSystem for Zio

This work-in-progress project is a IFileSystem implementation for PSArc files, for usage with Zio for .NET.

Goal of this project is to allow [Replanetizer](https://github.com/RatchetModding/Replanetizer) to read from .psarc files in the future.

Writing/editing existing archives is not currently on the roadmap.
